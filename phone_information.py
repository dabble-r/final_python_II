# Create your Contact class here

# Your Contact class should have THREE attributes: first_name, last_name, and phone_number
# These attributes must get their values from the constructor arguments (i.e. in your main.py in the code you're instructed not to modify, a first name, last name, and phone number are all passed IN THAT ORDER to each of the calls to the Contact() constructor)
# You should override the dunder methods for __eq__ (equality), __lt__ (less than), and __gt__ (greater than) so that your search will work!
